                Never say never
(Pick it up, pick, pick it up)
(Pick it up, pick, pick it up) Yeah, yeah
(Pick it up, pick, pick it up) never-ever, never-ever-ever-ever, eh, eh
(Pick it up, pick, pick it up) Ah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
See, I never thought that I could walk through fire (Eh)
I never thought that I could take the burn (Eh)
I never had the strength to take it higher (Eh)
Until I reached the point of no return (Eh)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight 'till forever 
            </pre>
